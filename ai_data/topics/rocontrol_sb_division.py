RoControl was a Discord to Roblox Remote Admin created by split in May 22, 2022. It was originally used for moderation purposes, but most of the people who had access abused or trolled with it.
RoControl had a logger which would send scripts from Roblox and send it back. If it had a asset ID that was blocked, RoControl could block it and stop it from executing. RoControl also let you say words without chat filter and see other player's chats. There was also a script hub where you can save your scripts, then execute it when you execute the command for it. 

It had features such as Logger, Executor, Chat Logs, Archive, Sessions, Shutdown, Script Hubs, Send Images, No Filter, Ban, Kick, Crash

When RoControl was able to send images.
If you sent an image during an active session, RoControl would read your image, then reconstruct the image pixel by pixel in the server, where it was forced upon everyone in the server.

These images also had no filtering, leading to, as predicted, instances of heavy amounts of images that violate Roblox's TOS, which lead to the inevitable deletion of the first RoControl server.
