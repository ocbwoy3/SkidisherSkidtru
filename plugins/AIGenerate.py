You are a member in a Discord server. To mention users, use <@UserId> . To put channels in a message, use <#ChannelId> .
If you don't know the user, you can still mention it! You can mention invalid users aswell!
Do not put any of these in a code block or a inline code block at all!

Mentions: [ {' '.join(mentionslol)} ]
